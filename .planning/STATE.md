# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** The core loop must work end-to-end: pick a topic and mechanic, generate text via Claude, render branded images from HTML/CSS templates, and export upload-ready PNGs - all guided by brand settings and performance insights.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & Rendering

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (Foundation & Rendering)
Plan: 0 of 3 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-10 - Roadmap created with 4 phases covering all 55 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Electron over web app: Desktop-first for beta testing, no server needed, Puppeteer runs natively
- SQLite over PostgreSQL: Single file, no server, full SQL power, trivial migration path later
- JSON for settings, SQLite for learning: Settings are small/rarely changed, learning data needs query power
- No starter templates: Visual template builder instead - users create custom templates
- Brand-aware data model: brand_id columns now prevent painful migration when multi-brand is needed
- Equal rotation cold start: No opinionated defaults - system learns purely from actual performance data
- Manual-first performance tracking: API-ready architecture, but manual input works completely standalone
- Claude API only: No LLM abstraction layer needed - single provider simplifies integration

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
